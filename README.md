# Project 3: Memory Allocator 

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
There is a problem that is causing my code to seg fault when I try to deference my freelist, this means somewhere within my code
I am not properly referencing the address or adding the pointers correctly.

DESIGN:
allocator - user created malloc, calloc, realloc, and free functions. More information for each function is in the c file.
